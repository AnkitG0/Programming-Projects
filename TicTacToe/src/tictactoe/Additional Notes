Game Logic: 
1. If the user selects X, he goes first. If the user selects O, the computer goes first.
2. If the game has not started yet, the grid buttons need to be inactive and start buttons to be active. When the game is ongoing, the Start X and Start O button needs to be inactive

Important to stop the program when the window is closed

Print statements are added to boardClick and startButtonPressed in TicTacToe to debug whether the click and start activity is working correctly
